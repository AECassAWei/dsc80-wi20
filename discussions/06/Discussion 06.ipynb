    "* Compute the distribution of `Letter Grades` conditional on `LVL`.\n",
    "* In `grades`, there are missing values in the `HWXX` columns. While we know that they are missing exactly when a student didn't turn in the assignment, we can still ask what the student may have gotten had they turned the assignment in. To follow this line of thought:\n",
    "    1. Check if the missingness of `HWXX` is dependent on `LVL`.\n",
    "    1. Check if the missingness of `HWXX` is dependent on `HWYY`. Since `HWYY` is quantitative, you should first convert it to letter grades, before checking dependency.\n",
    "    1. What are the test-statistics for testing the above two questions?\n",
