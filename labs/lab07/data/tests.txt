this is a great new case design that i have not seen before it has a slim silicone skin that really locks in the phone to cover and protect your phone from spills and such and also a hard polycarbonate outside shell cover to guard it against damage  this case also comes with different interchangeable skins and covers to create multiple color combinations  this is a different kind of case than the usual chunk of plastic  it is innovative and suits the iphone 5 perfectly
i brought this for my sister who has a g2 but not sure how it works yet  will let you know as soon as you update me updateit was too small  for  her  phone   per  the  description  should  fit her t  mobile galaxy but it  didn't  i  didn't  bother to  mail it back 
 i am both delighted and disappointed with dell venue pro  windows phone is the operating system of my choice primarily due to its productivity  venue pro is very much businesslike  precisely the type of mobile phone i want  however  the terrible power management makes it virtually unbearable to me let me give my ratings below first  on a scale of 10  with numbers in the parenthesis for iphone 4 as a reference  thermal performance   2  8 battery life   2  7 build quality  9  9 5 screen quality  9 5  9 5   processor   meaningless comparison  but see  speed and efficiency  os reliability   9 9  9 5 os fluency   9 5  9 0 os feature depth   6  9 os flexibility customization   5  8 os app ecosystem   5  9 5 productivity   9  5 form factor and appearance   completely subjectiveentertainment  9  9 speed and efficiency  9  7   yes the retina screen of iphone 4 has higher resolution  but the screen of venue pro looks slightly better under sunlight  in practice it's a wash as you can see above  venue pro even manages to beat iphone 4 in the few very important areas  but at the end of the day  it's just such a miserable device   the venue pro is otherwise a very capable phone  but the power management which includes thermal performance and battery life is so terrible  it really deserves a failing grade   a pity  because this phone with windows 7 5 would have been a quite attractive device the power management deserving of flunking gradefirst  it runs very warm in your hands  quite uncomfortable after just a few minutes of running a few apps  some email checking or web browsing  this is not only uncomfortable  but could actually be even a health concern  i know what heat and radiation of a mobile device can do to human body  my hands got a slowly burnt condition as a result of  longtime use of windows tablet computers  with venue pro  the thermal problem is so seriously bad that the issue alone makes it an extremely undesirable phone second  the battery life is miserable  not really surprising given the bad heat problem  this phone will not last a day  unless you don't use it at all   it can support only about 2 hours of continuous use  many times whorse than my laptop  it has just a bit over 24 hours of standby time even if you don't use it at all  again  many times worse than my laptop    any modestly use  for example  very modest amount of browsing and e mailing plus a few short calls  will exhaust the battery of this phone before the end of the day  i am not a heavy mobile user  and still i usually end up having to charge it at least once a day  when i'm out on a trip  twice or more a day  making it among the biggest mental burdens while you're traveling  simply not worth it  this is absolutely the worst battery performance among the many phones i have used or and handled   to me   this is simply unacceptable  it may be too much to ask for a phone that last for a week  especially with the smart phones becoming almost full featured computers  but failing to last even a single day is too much of a shortcoming mixed bag with the wp 7 5 osi love and hate windows phone os  the user interface is very intuitive  glitch free and just so smooth  which is every bit as good as ios  but much better than android    the best of all  however  is that windows phone os is the most productive smart phone os among the major platforms  if you are a content consumer  all three mobile platforms are shoulder to shoulder  but if you are a content creator  windows phone is far ahead  the iphone and android cannot match the power of microsoft's office 365 which integrates with microsoft phone perfectly   if you or your company subscribe to office 365 and use the cloud versions of the outlook  teamsite and sharepoint  the microsoft phone can do almost anything you can do using a laptop  although with certain limitations on the small user interface  even if you don't use office 365  getting the free windows live and skydive  which is very much underrated  would already be an excellent productive user experience another potentially killer app on wp is the just released skype  still beta  but very usable   if you use skype pro or skype out  you can actually make phone calls anywhere in the world as long as you have wi fi connection  no cellular connection is required  i was on an international trip the other day  and it came extremely handy  i was able to make calls back to home and work at the airports even though i did not have a sim card for the local service  even after i got a temporary local sim card  i continued to use skype on my windows phone to make calls using the 3g data service on the card  because it costs only two cents a minute  less than 1 20 of the cost for international calls made on that type of sim card   this is potentially a huge differentiator for windows phones  i hope microsoft can make the point clear for users   because they own skype  they could make it exclusive  if doing that helps to make windows phone a success  i am all for it  because i'd hate to see windows phone fail  i need something different from iphone or android for my lifestyle but the wp7 5 os is not fully cooked yet even with the latest mango update  the depth of customization is just not there just to name a few  1  you can't turn off that stupid screen auto rotation  you simply can't so far  no user settings has that  no app that does that  even unlocked phone can't do that  forgive me to call auto rotation feature stupid  but it is one of those tech things that made no sense on a mobile phone  precisely because a mobile phone is just so  mobile  the problem is that these device designers fail to understand that the proper  or desired  orientation of the screen simply cannot be determined by an orientation sensor  it is not a mechanical problem  it is a human problem  even if they were so sure that they could decide what the user desires based on a sensor reading  they still fail to understand that it is the relative positions of both the phone and the user's body posture that are more relevant  not the position of the phone itself  a mobile phone can be in many different positions in relation to the user's body position  and a single sensor is not capable to determine such relative positions  the current sensor can only detect the phone's orientation itself  not its relative position to the user's body posture   in practice  the autorotation causes much more annoyance than any utility  it is ok if they just want to use it as a gimmick to attract shallow feature counters  but it is not ok to have it permanently implemented and cannot be turned off  it's simply stupid actually  the reason why i make this auto rotation issue such a big deal is just to make a point  not because the thing itself is so life threatening  i can live with the annoyance  but the failure or overlook of such issues is very telling of the level of ergonomics the maker of this phone understands or is willing to make an effort to  2  you can't edit the individual fields of in a contact profile  and the given choices such as  mobile    home    home 2  are simply too rigid to satisfy even quite ordinary needs  3  copy and paste is still an issue  although works quite well within the same application  it does not work very reliably  across applications  it works across some applications but not others those are just several among many small details  microsoft has done the hard part of building a very promising mobile os  why is it so difficult for them to do these very basic and simple things right  it is obviously not an engineering issue   it is a product management issue  it is a company culture issue  microsoft's level of paying attention to details can't match that of ios  while its level of geekness can't match of that of android  so at the end it loses on both sides  perhaps wp really is meant for low level entry users  but with dell venue pro  we are talking about a business mobile phone here mixed bag with the hardwarethe hardware of dell venue pro is a mixed bag as well  in addition to the power management issue which is downright terrible  this phone is a little bit too bulky  particularly too thick  the thickness is partly a result of including a hard button keyboard  which i thought would be almost a necessity for someone like me  but turned out to be almost superfluous  ironically because the soft keyboard is extremely good and even has some significant advantages over the hard keyboard due to its programed flexibility and extensions   i personally think the soft keyboard of venue pro is even better than that of iphone 4  which itself is excellent  there are other details which dell failed to pay attention to  for example  the hard keyboard keys are illuminated  which is good  but the illumination does not turn on at the desired time  it does sometimes  but usually off when you actually needed  have no idea what they were thinking  clearly  neither microsoft nor dell is apple when it comes to paying attention to user experience details otherwise  the hardware is fine  the screen is beautiful  the iphone 4's retina screen may sound better in the specification  but in practice you really don't see any difference  both are extremely good  and the dell screen is actually better under the sunlight  the build quality is very high  although it uses a chipset and processor from three years ago  the phone is not slow in any measure  there simply isn't a problem in this aspect of all  i haven't compared it with iphone 4s  but the venue pro is actually faster than iphone 4  even though the latter uses a more powerful processor  this is a testament to the efficiency of microsoft phone os in summary  i don't recommend this phone  if one is interested in mobile productivity  microsoft phone is the platform to go  but this is not it  one should wait until microsoft phone 8 0  apollo  is put on a top of line nokia lumia 
of all the protectors i had seen for the nexus 4  this was the only nice looking one i could find that had a protector for the back of the phone  which is glass   this cover snaps on securely  yet is still easy to remove if pried the correct way   i have fumbled the phone a couple of times and the bumper has kept it completely safe   while i hate covering up the back   34 prism  34  glass on this phone  i would rather it be kept safe   with this and a halo screen protector  i have the phone fairly well covered in protection drawback   only one   due to the way the plastic protrudes over the buttons  sticking out somewhat from the bumper  they are often pressed accidentally   a minor complaint  but it is a little too easy to press them   for the protection given  i'll live with the trade off 
this screen protector is great for protection  ex  dropping it on gravel   the only cons i don't care for is the sticky feeling of the screen due to it being a soft screen protector  i also don't like the fact that the screen protector seems to have ripples all over it which is unnoticeable while the screen is on 
i bought this for my boyfriends birthday present after seeing his best friend with one  and this little jambox has been the answer to all of our portable music problems  it's tiny but man does it pack a punch  it has a good bass to it too  and that is impressive  it takes a few times to get the hang of how it works especially if you have two people connected to it but we got it down  the battery even lasts about 4 6 hours on constant play which again is impressive  we love love love this thing 
this iphone case is truly awesome  besides actually protecting the back and the screen of the phone  it has a metal kick stand attached to the back that i have not yet figured out how to use properly 
my wife uses her phone quit a bit all day and night  she gets almost two days from this battery  would buy again if needed 
very nice little item   stands out in your purse   it really is a generic clamshell with a little net  luggage holder  like the net on the back of a car trunk to hold your item in place  i use it for ear bud earphones   makes a cute little gift too   the cable tie is worthless  but no matter  not really needed with the little round case 
gets the job done  i dont use it everyday  its more of an assessory to camofauge my mobile phone  durible enough to withstand multiple dropps or falls  will purchase this brand again if needed
i bought this cover after using the samsung flip cover  i have an i stand  inc  sport model cell phone holder for the car and couldn't see my screen  now with this cover  my phone is protected and i can view the screen  it's also not bulky like an otter box  so i love it 
really awesome product  not bulky like some other screen protectors  doesn't affect typing or the viewing of things on the screen
i have tried the various 3m screen protectors and this one is great  hides your screen from others so you can view your data securely  i am not enamored with the cardboard applicator but it seems to do the trick  if you want the feel of glass  this is not the protector for you  however  if you want privacy  this is it 
i received my case today  i am skeptical of its performance  i have otter box cases for my other electronics so when i ordered this case i was expecting the same quality material as the otter box but less weight  for the price i was expecting something more durable  once i put the case on as instructed i tried to make a phone call and i realized that the sound was low too none  i had to mess around with the case and the buttons on the phone to get it to adjust so i can hear it  then i tried to plug in my head phones and i realized i can not use them without the headphone adapter  i am kind of scared to even put the case with my phone in water  even though it passed the water test without the phone  i am still scared  otter box spoiled me  i am expecting this lifeproof case to give me the same performance of a tank  like the otter box  i thought i would give this case a try to see if it stands up to its claims 
the price can not be beat on this product  for anyone with a tablet these work perfectly and best part is because of the price you are never worried about losing one 
i had this smartphone for about 2 months  and it is a great android os  it is the latest os so far at 2 2  and as matter of fact  some smartphones in the verizon and att networks are still running 2 1  so you'd be running a top of the line os battery life is great lasting all day long if you install one of the battery management apps such as  battery saver  and set it to turn off unused apps every 1 or 2 minutes  in my opinion this is the best app for the task  just make sure you set the right apps to be stopped  nothing worthwhile is easy the screen is bright and websites look beautiful  the only problem i have with this smartphone as well with any other touchscreen  including  er  iphone  is that the touchscreen keyboard sucks  it doesn't matter what people say  it is not easy to use a touchscreen keyboard  and it takes a big chunk of the screen  so  i'm letting this smartphone go  and i will get the samsung intercept which has a slide out keyboard  the way nature intended with real keys even though it doesn't have a dedicated graphics processor  i don't care  since i don't play video games much one thing i forgot is that the optimus v plays videogames fluidly  including angry birds and racing games  but playing video games on a touchscreen is not the way nature intended  buy a psp for that  later  
good sound a very good price looks good to and is comfortable in the ear so what more can i say 
work well with seniors who do not have good tactile fingers or large fingers on a ipad mini   price is great 
i bought red  blue and black  the black is my favorite  they do help protect the phone  and for the price these are really good cases  all the ports and holes are were they should be  i also like that they are tpu and not silicon because silicon starts to stretch after awhile  i also like having cases with stands because i like to watch a lot of media and these fit the bill  i also bought some more higher end cases like incipio  uag  and seidio active  etc 
this is the same charger that came with the razr v3 phone   light  compact  charges the phone 
i purchased this in hope the reviews that said it glowed were correct  unfortunately they were not  i tried editing my settings but nothing worked 
this is a great item for the price i paid for it  highly recommend it but if it gets just a lil wet u can wrap it up because it's over with
tips appear on stylus too large for galaxys3 disappointed  items also appear to be much more costly then they were last 
i have tried several  and failed  other bt head phones  both more and less expensive  and until now it's been bad   these sound great and have an incredible range  i use an iphone    they are very comfortable and come with additional ear pieces to fit any ears   the block outside noise wonderfully   they also work well when talking on the phone  people i have talked to say they sound normal  i haven't used them outside  so i don't know how well the cancel wind noise and such  
came with charger  extra battery  and i holster that you can charge a battery in was able to charge two batteries at once due to having two shargers and this geeat for a phone with little battery life 
i've tried this with many galsxy s3 phones and nothing it won't even charge my phone when i have the chargerin it      and the day i opened it there was something shaking inside the little white square  very bad buy and very disappointed
