    "# Summary of Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "<p>Power outage dataset includes data of power outage information in the continental U.S. from January 2000 to July 2016. A major power outage, for the purpose of this project, is defined as a power outage that impacted at least 50,000 customers or caused an unplanned firm load loss of atleast 300MW.</p>\n",
    "<p>This data provides valuable information that can be used to conduct future research in various paradigms, such as—state-level power outage risk maps for the continental U.S., predicting demand load loss, analyzing vulnerability of the U.S. states to frequent major power outages, and studying historical trends of major power outages. Other than basic information of state, climate, time, this dataset also includes electricity consumption patterns, economic characteristics, and land-use characteristics, each with many sub-sections to signify it's characteristics.</p>\n",
    "The problem I am trying to solve is \"predicting the cause cateogory of a major power outage\", and this would be a <b>classification</b> problem since \"cause category\" is categorical/nominal data. I would choose \"accuracy\" as my objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Baseline Model\n",
    "There are a total of 48 generic features I used to create my baseline model, of which 43 are continous varaibles, and 5 are nominal varaibles.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- The continuous variables include: ['YEAR', 'MONTH', 'ANOMALY.LEVEL', 'RES.PRICE', 'COM.PRICE', 'IND.PRICE', 'TOTAL.PRICE', 'RES.SALES', 'COM.SALES', 'IND.SALES', 'TOTAL.SALES','RES.PERCEN', 'COM.PERCEN', 'IND.PERCEN', 'RES.CUSTOMERS', 'COM.CUSTOMERS', 'IND.CUSTOMERS', 'TOTAL.CUSTOMERS', 'RES.CUST.PCT', 'COM.CUST.PCT', 'IND.CUST.PCT', 'PC.REALGSP.STATE', 'PC.REALGSP.USA', 'PC.REALGSP.REL', 'PC.REALGSP.CHANGE', 'UTIL.REALGSP', 'TOTAL.REALGSP', 'UTIL.CONTRI', 'PI.UTIL.OFUSA', 'POPULATION', 'POPPCT_URBAN', 'POPPCT_UC', 'POPDEN_URBAN', 'POPDEN_UC', 'POPDEN_RURAL', 'AREAPCT_URBAN', 'AREAPCT_UC', 'PCT_LAND', 'PCT_WATER_TOT', 'PCT_WATER_INLAND', 'DEMAND.LOSS.MW', 'CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED', 'OUTAGE.DURATION']\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- Whereas the nominal variables include: ['U.S._STATE', 'POSTAL.CODE', 'NERC.REGION', 'CLIMATE.REGION', 'CLIMATE.CATEGORY']\n",
    "\n",
    "<p> For the continuous variables, I impute the missing values with 0 to generate generic features. For the nominal variables, I used onehot encoding (handling_unknown='ignore') to generate my generic features.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Result & Intepretation\n",
    "Averaging over 100 trails of prediction and gennerating accuracy scores, I got a distribution of accuracy scores (below in the code) and find a score of __73.55__ using RandomForestClassifier() with default parameters. From my perspective, this score is relatively good, because a score 73.55 means that 73.55% of the prediction is correctly classified.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Model\n",
    "To generate a final models, new features are created using the generic columns. The are a total of 9 new features created. Specific detailed of what the new features are and why the new features are created are listed below:\n",
    "- 1) Log transformation of ['ANOMALY.LEVEL', 'DEMAND.LOSS.MW', 'CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED', 'OUTAGE.DURATION']\n",
    "    - Log transformation is used here to make highly skewed data less skewed so as to make the classification more \n",
    "- 2) Imputation of mean & distribution\n",
    "    - I examined the dependence of the missingness of 'DEMAND.LOSS.MW' (45.96% missing) and 'CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED' (28.87% missing) using permutation test and appropriate test statistics, and found that these two columns are MAR dependent on a lot of other columns, such as Year, Month, Anomaly levels, Outage Duration, Electricity consumption, Economic characteristic, and Land-use characteristic, and also on each other. Therefore, imputing the columns simply with 0 would disrupt the original distirbution of the data. Thus, I choose to impute thses two columns using distribution imputation.\n",
    "    - However, since other columns have really unbalanced missing/non-missing rate (all other columns that are missing values have a less than 4% missing rate), and examining columns with unblanced missing rate through imputations would not render easy-to-identify outcomes, I choose to impute those columns with means to differentiate from simply imputing with 0.\n",
    "- 3) PCA on categorical columns\n",
    "    - Other than just using onehot encoding to pre-process the categorical data, I also generate a new feature using PCA after using the onehot encoder. PCA serves as a means to decompose multiple features and synthesize them into the principal components, which serves as a comprehensive view on the categorical columns\n",
    "- 4) Onehot encoding on categorical columns dependent on cause category\n",
    "    - I also examine the dependence of cause category on different categorical columns using permutation test and test statistic of tvd, and found that cause category is dependent on 'U.S._STATE', 'POSTAL.CODE', 'NERC.REGION', 'CLIMATE.REGION'.\n",
    "    - Therefore, I choose use these columns as another main new feature to apply onehot encoding and PCA to generate a comprehensive feature of how the dependent categorical columns are.\n",
    "- 5) PCA on characteristic information\n",
    "    - Electricity consumption has 18 subsections, economic characteristic has 9 subsections, and land-use characteristic has 11 subsections. Since we need to further examine the relationship of land-use characteristics, electricity consumption patterns, and economic characteristics with cause category, it is better that we combine all the subsections within one characteristic into one wholistic and comprehensive value to represent each characteristic.\n",
    "    - Therefore, I also applied PCA on each characteristic information columns to generate three new characteristic information features.\n",
    "- 6) Polynomial features\n",
    "    - Other than dependece of cause category on categorical features, I also examine its dependence on continous columns, and found that cause category is dependent on 'YEAR', 'ANOMALY.LEVEL', 'DEMAND.LOSS.MW', 'CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED', 'OUTAGE.DURATION'. And since polynomial features (containing information such as x*y) are generate to capture the dependence within each columns, and these columns are also dependent on cause category, it would be useful to have such as polynomial feature representing the dependence.\n",
    "- 7) Standardization, 8) Normalization, 9) Power Transformation\n",
    "    - These three feature are applied on the continuous columns that cause category are dependent on (i.e. 'YEAR', 'ANOMALY.LEVEL', 'DEMAND.LOSS.MW', 'CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED', 'OUTAGE.DURATION'). These three transformation made the distribution of the continuous data more normalize and stadardized. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "After simply using the default RandomForestClassifier() parameters to average over 100 trials of accuracy scores, I got an accuracy score of __76.32__, which improves the original baseline model's accuracy score by almost 2%. Right after the new featured models are created, I conduct a model search (models include DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, KNeighborsClassifier, SGDClassifier, and GradientBoostingClassifier) by hand (I comment out most of the code, because it takes a long long time for some of them to actually finish running), and a parameter search using GridSearchCV. Results are shown in the __Result & Interpretation__ section below.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Result & Intepretation\n",
    "I found that GradientBoostingClassifier() has the best perforamcen (accuracy score) with an average accuracy score over 100 trials of __82.54__, with parameter of max_depth=10, min_samples_leaf=2, min_samples_split=3, which means that averaging over 100 trials 82.54% of the cause category in the testing sets are accurately prediceted, a 6% increase from the original performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fairness Evaluation\n",
    "I wanted to see if there is a difference in prediction for cause cateogry before July and after July. So I separate the data sets into before July and after July groups. I then performed a permutation test to see if there is true positive difference between the prediction before July and the predictiona after July. I choose recall scores/sensitivity as my test statistics because correctly predicting the cause cateogry is more important in my case. If we correctly predict the cause category of the outage, then we would be able to more successfully determine and solution and tackle the problems.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- Null Hypothesis: The scores are not different in terms of True Positive Parity\n",
    "- Alternative Hypothesis: The scores are different in terms of True Positive Parity\n",
    "- Test statistics: sensitivity/recall score\n",
    "- Alpha level: 0.05\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "I found a p value of 0.27, which is larger than the pre-determined alpha level. Therefore, I do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, meaning that the model there is probably no bias for before July and after July groups prediction."
